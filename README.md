# Evolduo App

[![evolduo app](https://github.com/kongeor/evolduo-app/actions/workflows/evolduo_app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kongeor/evolduo-app/actions/workflows/evolduo_app.yml)

## What is it?

Evolduo is platform for collaborative musical synthesis using evolutionary algorithms. It is open source and free to use.

In more understandable terms, what evolduo attempts to do is to try to compose a [musical phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_(music))
that will be played on top a predefined chord progression with the use of [evolutionary algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm)
As the creator of this evolution process you will be able to access and listen all the generated phrases for each iteration
step. Rating the phrases will affect the evaluation of the algorithm ([fitness function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_function))
and will shift the results more to your liking. If participating in this process is not fun enough, you will have the
option to invite friends and do it with them, because doing things with friends is always more fun.

## Is it good?

[Yes.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434)


## Audio samples

## Issues and Contribution

There are some [known issues](https://github.com/kongeor/evolduo-app/blob/main/doc/known_issues.md).

If you see something that is wrong, you can fill in a [github issue](https://github.com/kongeor/evolduo-app/issues).

If you want to request/propose a feature, please see the roadmap and future work below. I'm interested in exploring different areas in
this space but I'll not be able to do that before the end of Summer 2023.



## Roadmap

The roadmap is shaped based on my thesis requirements and the amount of my spare time:

- mid October 2022, release announcement 
- ~ mid October 2022 - mid January 2023, feature freeze, essential bug fixing, UI improvements 
- Summer 2023, thesis completion and presentation, announcement of usage stats (and probably providing the equivalent dataset)


## Future Work

This is an exciting and fun space and there are many things to tinker with and explore. Those are just some of mine
ideas that I could be poking with after I'm done with my thesis:

- Extend the music capabilities. There are no rests, and just eights, quarters and halfs right now. Triplets would be fun too.
- Allowing custom chord progressions is a viable enhancement. 
- Moar scales.
- Extract the evolduo core so it can function as a standalone tool. And then try to integrate it with existing tools
such as [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/).


## Support

If you like this project and want to support its development, you can do the following:

- Just use the app. At this stage this is the most useful thing as I need user usage statistics to include in my work.
- Spread the word, or, something even more radical, grab a [sample](https://evolduo.cons.gr/samples) and use it as a ringtone on your
mobile phone. There's no way people will not ask you what in the world is that music and thus will learn about this project.
- Gimme your moniez!
